# anomaly-detection
This project is a deep learning-based anomaly detection system for classifying Aadhaar card images as real or fake using autoencoders. The autoencoder is trained to reconstruct real Aadhaar images with minimal error. If a new input image cannot be reconstructed accurately it's flagged as fake.
